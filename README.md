<h2>Point Cloud Base 3D Model Generation and Volume Calculation Program</h2>
</p>A project assigned to me during the industrial training program. The project objective was to design a solution for calculating the volume of oil tanks using 3D cloud point data. I implemented the necessary algorithms for calculating the volume.</p>
